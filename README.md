# 3D Shooter

​[Itch.io](https://daniel-work-gh.itch.io/3d-game)

This is a combination of 2 homework questions - 
1. Scene modeling: the scene  we made in class kept crashing so I made it in a new map without connecting to the main building we saw in class.
2. Player handling: I decided to implement more then was asked so I programmed the following - walking, running, jumping, interacting, and shooting.   

The terrain was created using a height map generated from the Ariel's topology.

Controls:

​Movement - WASD
Shoot - Left mouse button
Restock Ammo - E

​Enemies will spawn every so often and when you shoots them his score will go up. When out of bullets you can restock in the stone house near the spawn.​​
